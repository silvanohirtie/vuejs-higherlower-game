## Made With
FrontEnd:
- VueJS
- JavaScript
- CSS
- SkeletonCSS  

BackEnd:
- Node.js
- Express

## Usage
The Code takes a random array that is composed by:
- Name  
- Search  
- Image  

That array comes from a variable in the javascript code, you could use a JSON file or better, a not rational database such as MongoDB.  

## The Game
Your goal is to get as many points as you can by guessing which of the two options is the most searched on the internet.

## Problems
At the start of the game, sometimes you have to fail to continue playing, this happens only if running it on your machine.+
Probabily caused by lite-server (the module I was using to run the server)
